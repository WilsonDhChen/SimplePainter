bugs:
.> bounds checking for ImageHandler::fill

flaws:
.> proper file extensions in open and save as file dialogs
.> size selection for new images
.> proper destructors
.> "would you like to save" dialog on open new file and shutdown
.> "fit to screen" should be changed to "normal size"

additional features:
.> add sytem clipboard options to edit menu
.> populate status bar(toolname, filename, (x,y))
.> different circle and elipse tools
.> color replace tool
.> transparency control
.> smarter undo -smaller memory footprint, more levels, possibly a history of all
